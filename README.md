# Carplate-Recognition
Using OpenCV and EasyOCR to extract number plate text from images of carplates

This is done by first loading the image into python using Opencv. Then, we apply filtering, edge detection of contours to search and extract the area of the image that contains the carplate. Finally, we using  deep learning powered optical character recognition, Easy OCR  to be able to extract number plate text.
